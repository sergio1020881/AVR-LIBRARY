WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A NOTE:

People should stop being rude and not plagiarize other peoples work, at least mention their recognition, this also applies in work environment were people steel ideias, atitudes and actual creations or inventions (work), if by any chance this is done at least give recognition of the source and you will get much more respect and consideration for when it comes to your turn you will also feel recognised. For higher education enforces this atitude and condemns this type of attitude, for i to feel the desire to give recognition to those whom ideias and new prcedures are created by their influence, and always want others to know more and do more then I so that my job is made easier and less painfull.

So thanks to all those that create and put out there their projects for scrutiny and analyses.
